Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "hisilicon,l3t-pmu".
  - reg : should contain at least address and length of the L3T PMU

  - interrupts : one L3T interrupt should be described here.

Example
    l3t0@81170000 {
        compatible = "hisilicon,l3t-pmu";
        hisilicon,scl-id = <1>;
        hisilicon,ccl-id = <0>;
        hisilicon,index-id = <1>;
        reg = <0x0 0x81170000 0x0 0x10000>;
        interrupts = <0x0 316 0x4>;
    };
