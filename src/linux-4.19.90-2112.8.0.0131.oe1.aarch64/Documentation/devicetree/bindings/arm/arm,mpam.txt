Memory System Resource Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM), for Armv8-A
----------------------------------------------------------

The MPAM is used to limit memory bandwidth and cache usage for ARM platform.
The required properties for driver is:
	compatible = "arm,mpam";  /* MPAM for Arm */
	reg = <>; /* mpam device base register */

The property type must be included, it is used to indicate type of mpam
device for the node. There are several type of mpam device:
	MPAM_CLASS_SMMU = 0,
	MPAM_CLASS_CACHE,   /* Well known caches, e.g. L2 */
	MPAM_CLASS_MEMORY,  /* Main memory */
	MPAM_CLASS_UNKNOWN, /* Everything else, e.g. TLBs etc */

The type of memory is set as:
	type = <2>;
The type of cache is set as:
	type = <1>;

MPAM support interrupt for error and overflow, the error-interrupt and
overflow-interrupt are defined in "Memory System Resource Partitioning
and Monitoring (MPAM), for Armv8-A", MPAM interrupts(section 8.8).
	overflow-interrupt = <0>;
	overflow-flags = <0>;
	error-interrupt = <0>;
	error-interrupt-flags = <0>;

Example:

mpam_memory0 {
	compatible = "arm,mpam";
	reg = <0x0 0x10000000 0x0 0x10000>;
	type = <2>; /* memory type */
	numa-node-id = <0>;
	overflow-interrupt = <0>;
	overflow-flags = <0>;
	error-interrupt = <0>;
	error-interrupt-flags = <0>;
	not-ready-max = <0>;
};

mpam_cache0 {
	compatible = "arm,mpam";
	reg = <0x0 0x20000000 0x0 0x10000>;
	type = <1>; /* cache type */
	cache-id = <0>;
	cache-level = <3>;
	overflow-interrupt = <0>;
	overflow-flags = <0>;
	error-interrupt = <0>;
	error-interrupt-flags = <0>;
	not-ready-max = <0>;
};
